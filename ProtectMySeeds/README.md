# ProtectMySeeds

## Description
This mod will allow for saplings to drop the seeds used to plant them if they're broken by a player or creature. 

Did you plant one of your valuable turnip seeds too close to another one on accident? Break it and recover the seed! Did you set up a farm that started to get destroyed by boars? Pick up the seeds! 

This also works on tree saplings, barley, flax, Jotunn puffs, Magecap, and more. This mod will also recover grown pickable plants, such as carrots, turnips, and onions, if they're broken.

## Detailed info
This mod does not change the behavior of bushes (raspberry, blueberry, cloudberry, etc.) or any other plants that remain after being picked (such as fruit bearing trees added by other mods). Mature crops that are broken instead of picked will NOT increase your farming skill!

## Mod compatibility
Any mod that adds saplings (plants before they mature) should be compatible. I built this mod to be compatible with PlantEverything to avoid any conflicts. Please report any conflicts you find using the Contact section below.

## Installation
This mod can be installed only on the client side, though that will limit the functionality only to the clients who have it installed. Installing this on the server side will force all clients to have the mod, and will ensure the expected mod behavior.

## Troubleshooting
If a client sees a disconnect message that says "Incompatible version" it means the mod is installed on the server and not installed on the client. Check the server log for more information.
